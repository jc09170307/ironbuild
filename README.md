Install: open the site on your phone, then Share / menu > Add to Home Screen.

## Changing the app icon
Replace these PNGs in `icons/` (same file names, square, subject centered):
- `icon-192.png` (192x192), `icon-512.png` (512x512)
- `maskable-512.png` (512x512, keep the subject inside the middle 60% so phone icon shapes don't crop it)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180, for iPhone)

Then bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` (e.g. `iron-build-v3`). To see the new icon, delete the app from your home screen and add it again.
